The Event Registration Management System is a single-page web application developed using React, Redux Toolkit, and JSON Server. The application is designed to manage participant registrations for an event or conference in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

This system allows users to add, view, and delete event registrations with real-time UI updates. It demonstrates modern frontend development practices such as controlled components, global state management using Redux, asynchronous API handling, and client-side form validation.

The project is built using Vite for fast development and optimized performance, making it suitable for academic projects as well as practical learning of React and Redux concepts.
